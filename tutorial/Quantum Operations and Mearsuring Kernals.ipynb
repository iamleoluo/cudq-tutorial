    "# Quantum Computing 101\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental unit of classical information storage, processing and transmission is the bit. Analogously, we define its quantum counterpart, a quantum bit or simply the qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical bits are transistor elements whose states can be altered to perform computations. Similarly, qubits too have physical realizations within superconducting materials, ion-traps and photonic systems. We shall not concern ourselves with specific qubit architectures but rather think of them as systems which obey the laws of quantum mechanics and the mathematical language physicists have developed to describe the theory: linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum States\n",
    "\n",
    "Information storage scales linearly if bits have a single state. Access to multiple states, namely a 0 and a 1 allows for information encoding to scale logarithmically. Similarly, we define a qubit to have the states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ in Dirac notation where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|0\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad |1\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than just the two states each classical bit can be in, quantum theory allows one to explore linear combinations of states, also called superpositions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}$. It is important to note that this is still the state of one qubit; although we have two kets, they both represent a superposition state of one qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two classical bits, the possible states we could encode information in would be `00`, `01`, `10` and `11`. Correspondingly, multiple qubits can be combined and the possible combinations of their states used to process information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-qubit system has four computational basis states: $|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle, |11\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the quantum state of an $n$-qubit system is written as a sum of $2^n$ possible basis states where the coefficients track the probability of the system collapsing into that state if a measurement is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $n = 500$, $2^n \\approx 10^{150}$ which is greater than the number of atoms in the universe. Storing the complex numbers associated with $2^{500}$ amplitudes would not be feasible using bits and classical computations but nature seems to only require 500 qubits to do so. The art of quantum computation is thus to build quantum systems that we can manipulate with fine precision such that evolving a large statevector can be offloaded onto a quantum computer."
